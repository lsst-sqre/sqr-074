Abstract
========

The purpose of Phalanx has expanded from its original role specific to the Rubin Science Platform to providing an installation and configuration platform for a variety of Kubernetes clusters. New, minimal installations need validation to ensure that basic services are running correctly, including mechanisms to both manually and automatically test. This tech note proposes a new validation service plus supporting infrastructure for automated testing.
